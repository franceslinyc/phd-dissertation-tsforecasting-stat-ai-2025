In this part of the dissertation, we review existing models for zero-inflated dependent count and continuous data, as well as the continuous extension approach, and propose a novel copula-based zero-inflated MTD model that extends the existing framework. We also present the algorithms and simulation studies, which demonstrate promising results across various scenarios. The advantage of our proposed approach is that, by reconstructing semi-continuous distributions into continuous forms, it preserves the effectiveness of copula modeling for capturing dependence structures, while retaining flexibility in the selection of marginal distributions in zero-inflated continuous settings. 

We treat the threshold parameter as a variable rather than fixing it. The threshold is a nuanced parameter that can  influence model outcome, and fixing it arbitrarily might overlook important variations in performance. Future work could include a sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the threshold affect model performance. 

In real-world settings, dependence structures often exhibit features such as tail dependence or asymmetry that cannot be adequately captured by the Gaussian copula. Further research should explore alternative copula families, such as the Clayton or Gumbel copulas, along with efficient estimation techniques and practical applications, to better capture complex dependence patterns in empirical data. 

Although the framework can be readily extended to handle non-stationary time series and incorporate predictors [@zheng2022construction], these features are not currently implemented. Consequently, it cannot adequately model non-stationary data with trends and seasonality, limiting its practical effectiveness. In addition, the lack of support for covariate prevents the model from jointly capturing the effects of past observations and relevant covariate. A key future direction is to extend the framework for non-stationary and regression-based settings. Such an extension would enable the model to handle changing dynamics and incorporate both sources of information, thereby improving its flexibility and applicability to real-world data. 

Finally, we use MCMC as our primary sampling method, but alternative approaches such as Variational Inference or Sequential Monte Carlo could also be explored. These alternatives offer different trade-offs between computational efficiency and approximation accuracy. Future work could involve a comparison of these methods to assess how the choice of sampling strategy impacts model performance.
