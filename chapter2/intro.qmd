# Introduction {#sec-ch2-intro}

Zero-inflated data are characterized by an excess of zero values. In these data types, observations often feature a point mass at zero, followed by values from a separate distribution that can be discrete, continuous, or otherwise non-zero. Zero-inflated count data frequently occur in a wide range of domains, including finance, economics, healthcare, transportation, and ecology. While zero-inflated count data have been studied extensively, zero-inflated continuous, or semicontinuous, data also arise frequently in practice. Examples of semicontinuous data are medical expenditures [@duan1983comparison; @neelon2015bayesian; @neelon2016modeling; @neelon2016modelingpart2; @liu2019statistical], insurance claims [@shi2018pair; @yang2022nonparametric], precipitation amounts [@hyndman2000applications; @abraham2009semi; @dzupire2018poisson; @kaewprasert2024bayesian], lane departure severity scores [@mills2013zigamma], and vehicle deceleration during braking [@feng2020zero]. 

There are two classes of models designed to handle data with excessive zeros: two-component, zero-inflated (ZI) models [@lambert1992zero] and two-part, hurdle models [@mullahy1986specification]. Both models employ a mixture of a binary component modeling zeros and a separate component modeling non-zero values, which can be either count or continuous. The key distinction lies in the source of zeros. In ZI models, zeros may arise from both the binary and non-zero components, whereas in hurdle models, zeros occur exclusively in the binary component, with the non-zero component restricted to non-zero values. 

Building upon the architecture of the MTD model introduced in 2022 by @zheng2022construction, in Part I we proposed the copula-based Gamma MTD model, which enables flexible dependence modeling and accommodates arbitrary continuous marginals, thereby enhancing modeling capabilities and flexibility. However, while this framework addresses the challenge of constructing a flexible transition kernel for non-Gaussian marginal distributions, it remains limited in handling excessive zeros commonly observed in real-world continuous data. 

To address this limitation, we propose reconstructing the marginal distribution to account for zero-inflation. Our approach is similar to hurdle models in that it models zero and non-zero values separately. Unlike hurdle models, however, it applies a soft threshold that replaces zeros with small non-zero values rather than generating exact zeros. Building on the continuous extension (CE) approach [@denuit2005constraints], this technique transforms zero-inflated marginal distributions into continuous distributions, thereby mitigating the identifiability issues that copulas face when modeling discrete or mixed marginals [@genest2007primer]. This CE-based reformulation enables copulas to effectively capture complex dependence while accurately modeling zero-inflated continuous marginals. The proposed copula-based zero-inflated MTD model extends the copula-based MTD model by accommodating zero-inflation, thereby enhancing its applicability and flexibility for handling mixed data with excess zeros. 

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We review several zero-inflated (ZI) count and continuous models for dependent data, as well as the continuous extension (CE) approach in @sec-ch2-background. We present the proposed model in @sec-ch2-prop and provide an overview of the MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation in @sec-ch2-comp. We present the results of various simulations conducted to assess the accuracy and performance of the proposed model in @sec-ch2-simu and discuss the model’s predictive capabilities, including uncertainty quantification, in @sec-ch2-pred. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in @sec-ch2-discussion. @sec-appendix-ch1-pkag provides the instruction for installing the extended `mtd` `R` package.
