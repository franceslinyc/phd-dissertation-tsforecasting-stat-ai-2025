    "text": "1.1 Motivation and Objective\nModeling complex patterns in sequence data is a central task across domains such as energy, insurance, and transportation. Real-world time series often exhibit skewness and zero-inflation, which, if unaddressed, undermine prediction accuracy. For example, wind speeds are typically skewed, while medical expenditures, insurance claims, and transportation safety measures may also include an excess of zeros. These features highlight the need for flexible models capable of capturing both continuous skewed behavior and semicontinuous, zero-inflated structures. Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 illustrate the skewed and zero-inflated time series that motivate the design choices.\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced powerful deep learning architectures, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models effectively capture nonlinear and long-range dependence in data, offering fast predictions without explicit probabilistic assumptions. Nevertheless, claims of LSTM superiority can be misleading when compared against inappropriate benchmarks such as ARIMA models. In addition, prior work has found comparable predictive performance between probabilistic Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) model and deep learning LSTM network for disease spread. These considerations motivate a more rigorous comparison of deep learning approaches with flexible probabilistic models designed to handle nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and zero-inflated dynamics, providing a more realistic benchmark than traditional methods.\nWhile deep learning methods offer powerful predictive capabilities, classical statistical approaches remain indispensable, especially when robustness, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification are priorities. We propose the Gamma Mixture Transition Distribution (Gamma MTD) and the Zero-Inflated Gamma MTD (ZIGamma MTD) models, which extend the traditional MTD framework through a copula-based formulation. These models provide flexible and interpretable frameworks for skewed and zero-inflated time series, enabling accurate representation of both continuous and semicontinuous dynamics commonly observed in real-world applications, while also allowing a fair comparison with deep learning methods such as LSTMs.\nThis dissertation develops the Gamma MTD and ZIGamma MTD models, evaluates their predictive performance and robustness, and compares them with modern deep learning approaches such as LSTMs. By integrating insights from both probabilistic and AI-driven frameworks, this work highlights their complementary strengths and limitations, providing a clearer picture of their practical applications. We expand on these points in the sections that follow.",

    "text": "1.2 Data Challenges\nTo account for skewness and zero-inflation commonly observed in real-world time series, we develop a copula-based Gamma MTD model and its zero-inflated extension, ZIGamma MTD, providing a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for modeling such data type.\nThe Gamma MTD model extends the original MTD framework by incorporating copulas into the transition kernels. This allows the dependence structure to be modeled separately from the marginal distributions, enabling the selection of copula families that effectively capture complex dependence while maintaining flexibility in the choice of marginals. As a result, the model offers enhanced modeling capabilities and greater adaptability to diverse data characteristics.\nThe ZIGamma MTD model further extends the copula-based Gamma MTD to handle zero-inflated data by reconstructing the marginal distribution. By transforming semi-continuous distributions into fully continuous ones, this approach overcomes the challenges posed by non-continuity in the copula approach. As a result, the model preserves its effectiveness in modeling dependence structures while retaining flexibility in the choice of marginals.\nBy developing and evaluating the Gamma MTD and ZIGamma MTD models, this work aims to provide a robust and flexible framework for modeling complex time series, addressing both skewness and zero-inflation while preserving interpretability and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Time series plot of observed hourly wind speeds (m/s) at heights of (a) 50 m, (b) 10 m, and (c) 2 m above ground level at the Limon Wind Energy Center, Colorado, for the year 2024.

They are particularly effective for non-Gaussian, skewed, and zero-inflated data. The copula-based formulation further enhances their ability to model continuous and semicontinuous patterns.\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including LSTMs, model temporal dependence by propagating recurrent units over time. These networks learn internal states directly from data using backpropagation through time (BPTT) without relying on explicit probabilistic assumptions. LSTMs efficiently capture long-range nonlinear dependence, making them well-suited for fast prediction on large-scale datasets.\nAlthough both MTD models and LSTMs describe evolving dynamics, they differ fundamentally. MTD models employ probabilistic transition mechanisms, whereas LSTMs rely on deterministic, learned transformations of hidden and cell states. This distinction has practical implications: MTD models tend to provide higher predictive accuracy, improved robustness, and greater interpretability, but at greater computational cost and with more complex model design. LSTMs offer faster predictions and simpler deployment, but with lower interpretability and potentially reduced accuracy.\nBy combining insights from both classical and AI-driven frameworks, this work aims to provide practical guidance for modeling time series with complex, skewed, and zero-inflated patterns.",

    "text": "Time series data consist of observations measured at regular time intervals. In these data types, observations often exhibit temporal dependence; that is, observations from recent time lags tend to be similar. Examples of time series data are sensor readings, stock prices, sale figures, energy production, weather data, and various other metrics.\nTime series models capture how past values contribute to the current value and use this information to predict future values. In the autoregressive (AR) model with order \\(p\\), for example, each current value depends on all \\(p\\) past values, with fixed, deterministic weights. The mixture transition distribution (MTD) model extends the AR models to accommodate discrete, continuous, and mixed time series, expanding its range of applications. The MTD model models each conditional distribution as a mixture of transition kernels, with random, stochastic weights.\nThe first MTD model was developed in 1985 to model high-order Markov chains (Raftery 1985a, 1985b), followed by several variant models over the years. Our work builds upon the architecture of the MTD model introduced in 2022 by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022). This model includes various applications, such as the Gaussian MTD, Poisson MTD, negative binomial MTD, and Lomax MTD regression models, extending beyond linear, Gaussian dynamics. However, there are two limitations. First, under this model framework, the transition kernel lacks component-varying parameters. Second, for certain invariant marginal distributions, the transition kernel may either require careful construction or can result in a form that is not explicitly defined or too complex.\nWe propose to incorporate copulas into the transition kernels to address the second limitation. Using copulas, dependence structures and marginal distributions can be modeled separately, enabling a choice of copula families that effectively capture data’s dependence while allowing flexibility in marginal selection. The proposed copula-based MTD model enables flexible dependence modeling and accommodates any continuous marginals, thereby enhancing modeling capabilities and flexibility.\nThe rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We review the MTD model developed by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) in Chapter 3. We present the proposed model in Chapter 4 and provide an overview of the MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation in Chapter 5. We present the results of various simulations conducted to assess the accuracy and performance of the proposed model in Chapter 6 and discuss the model’s predictive capabilities, including uncertainty quantification, in Chapter 7. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Chapter 8.

    "text": "3.1 Mixture Transition Distribution Models for Time Series\nThe MTD model is a state space model. The MTD model was initially developed in 1985 to model high-order Markov chains (Raftery 1985a, 1985b). On a finite state space, the model offers a parsimonious approximation of higher-order Markov chains. On a more general state space, the model can capture non-Gaussian and nonlinear features, such as flat stretches, bursts, outliers, and change points (Raftery 1994; Le, Martin, and Raftery 1996). The class of MTD models and their generalizations have diverse applications, including wind power forecasting, social behavior analysis, DNA sequence modeling, and forecasting of stock prices and inflation rates. A complete review of the MTD model and its applications can be found in Berchtold and Raftery (2002). Recent applications extend to the modeling of crime incidents and precipitation patterns (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2022) and the network analysis of financial markets (D’Amico, De Blasis, and Petroni 2023). Although the MTD model has primarily been used for modeling time series, its generalizations has also demonstrated success in modeling spatial data. Some applications within the spatial context can be found in Berchtold (2001), Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023b), and Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023a).\nIn the general MTD model framework, the joint data distribution over a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is modeled as a weighted combination of first-order component densities or transition kernels. A DAG simplifies complex relationships in the data, enabling flexible and parsimonious multivariate non-Gaussian modeling. Let \\(\\{ X_t: t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}\\) be a time series, represented by a sequence of random variables in an arbitrary state space and \\(f(\\textbf{x})\\), where \\(\\textbf{x} = {(X_1,..., X_t)}^T\\), be the joint distribution of \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_t\\). By applying the chain rule of probability theory and constructing the model on a DAG, the joint distribution of \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_t\\) can be factorized into a product of conditional distributions as\n\\(f(x_t | \\textbf{x}^{t-1})\\) is the conditional probability density function (pdf) of current value \\(X_t\\) given all of its past values \\(\\textbf{X}^{t-1} = \\textbf{x}^{t-1}\\), where \\(\\textbf{X}^{t-1} = \\{X_i: i \\leq t - 1 \\}\\) and \\(\\textbf{x}^{t-1} = \\{x_i: i \\leq t - 1 \\}\\). The joint distribution in \\(\\eqref{eq:joint_distribution}\\) corresponds to a directed graphical model (Jordan (2004); also known as a Bayesian network), where the conditional independence structure among the random variables is encoded by a DAG. Figure \\(\\ref{Linear}\\) and \\(\\ref{DAG}\\) provide visual illustrations of the linear and directed relationships between \\(X_1\\) through \\(X_t\\) on a DAG, respectively. In Figure \\(\\ref{DAG}\\), let \\(X_1, ..., X_t\\) be vertices or nodes in a graph. The set \\(\\textbf{X}^{t-1}\\), which consists of nodes that have directed edges pointed to \\(X_t\\), is called the parent or conditioning set of \\(X_t\\).\nAs \\(t\\) increases, the size of the conditioning set of \\(X_t\\) can become notably large. Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) address the challenge of modeling a non-Gaussian conditional density with a high-dimensional conditioning set using the structured mixture model. When the order of the MTD model is set to \\(L \\ll t\\), the conditioning set of \\(x_t\\) is reduced to \\(\\{x_{t-L}, ..., x_{t-1} \\} \\subset \\{x_1, ..., x_{t-1}\\}\\). Consequently, in Figure \\(\\ref{DAG}\\), the number of directed edges pointing to each \\(X_t\\) is reduced to at most \\(L\\). Each current value in the MTD model references only to the \\(L\\) lagged values, rather than the entire history of the time series.\nEach conditional in \\(\\eqref{eq:joint_distribution}\\) is modeled as a mixture of \\(L\\) transition kernels, with mixture weights. Transition kernels, similar to transition probabilities in discrete-valued time series, describe how a probability distribution moves from one state to another in a stochastic process, but applied to continuous or more general state spaces. Transition kernels represent the influence of the \\(l\\)th lag value on the current value. Mixture weights indicate the contribution of that influence. Let \\(\\{ X_t: t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}\\) be a time series, represented by a sequence of random variables in an arbitrary state space. For \\(t &gt; L\\), the MTD model specifies the conditional distribution of \\(X_t\\) given \\(\\textbf{X}^{t-1} = \\textbf{x}^{t-1}\\) as\n\\(f_l (x_t | x_{t-l})\\) is the conditional pdf of \\(X_t\\) with respect to the \\(l\\)th transition kernel given that \\({X}_{t-l} = {x}_{t-l}\\). \\(w_l\\) are weight parameters, where \\(w_l \\geq 0\\) such that \\(\\sum_{l=1}^L w_l = 1\\). Transition kernels in \\(\\eqref{eq:cond_distribution}\\) capture dependence between the current value and its lag values. Weight parameters assign specific weights to the transition kernels, determining the relative contribution of the lagged values’ influence. We will expand the discussion of transition kernels and mixture weights in the next section.",

    "text": "3.2 Model Construction\nEarlier MTD models were built using frequentist approaches. Estimation and prediction in the MTD model by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) is constructed with a focus on Bayesian methodologies.\n\n3.2.1 Mixture Weights\nZheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) consider three weight types: weights with a uniform Dirichlet prior, a truncated version of the stick-breaking prior, and the cdf-based Dirichlet process prior. We use the weight with the cdf-based prior, which will be the focus of our discussion.\nLet \\(x_k \\in [0, 1]\\) with \\(\\sum_{k=1}^K x_k = 1\\). The Dirichlet distribution, denoted as \\(Dirichlet(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\\), is a discrete distribution on \\([0, 1]^K\\). It is characterized by a vector of concentration parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\), where \\(\\alpha_k &gt; 0\\), and the mean of \\(x_k\\) is \\(\\alpha_k / \\sum_{k=1}^K \\alpha_k\\), for \\(k=1,...,K\\). The Dirichlet process, denoted as \\(DP(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{G})\\), is a discrete distribution over probability distributions. The Dirichlet process generates a distribution that shrinks around a base distribution \\(\\boldsymbol{G}\\), with the degree of shrinkage controlled by a concentration parameter \\(\\alpha\\). The base distribution determines the form of the distribution generated by the Dirichlet process, and the concentration parameter controls the degree of shrinkage of the resulting distribution toward the base distribution.\nThe weight associated with a cdf-based Dirichlet process prior assumes that the weights are increments of a cdf \\(G\\). This prior is denoted as \\(CDP(\\cdot | \\boldsymbol{1}_L / L)\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{1}_L\\) is a unit vector of length \\(L\\). It is constructed as follows. First assume that the weights are increments of a cdf \\(G\\) on the support \\([0,1]\\); that is,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw_l = G(l/L) - G((l - 1)/L), \\quad l = 1,..., L.   \n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext place a Dirichlet process prior on \\(G\\), denoted as \\(DP(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_0, \\boldsymbol{G}_0)\\), where \\(\\alpha_0 &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{G}_0 = Beta(a_0, b_0)\\). Then the vector of weights follows a Dirichlet distribution with parameter vector \\(\\alpha_0 {(a_1, ..., a_L)}^T\\), where \\(\\alpha_0 &gt; 0\\) and \\(a_l = G_0(l/L) - G_0((l - 1)/L)\\), for \\(l = 1,..., L\\). Together, these parameters determine how the data is allocated across the \\(l\\) intervals on the support of the weight distribution and the initial shape of the distribution. Using the Dirichlet process as a nonparametric prior for \\(G\\) allows for general distributional shapes and thus provides flexibility in estimating the mixture weights.\n\n\n3.2.2 Transition Kernels\nEach transition kernel in \\(\\eqref{eq:cond_distribution}\\) corresponds to the distribution for a random pair \\((U_l, V_l)\\), for \\(l = 1,..., L\\). That is, \\(f_l \\equiv f_{U_l | V_l}\\), where \\(f_l\\) denotes the transition kernel and \\(f_{U_l | V_l}\\) is the associated conditional density. Necessary and sufficient conditions for constant first and second moments are difficult to establish. Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) offer an alternative condition on the marginal densities of bivariate distributions that define the transition kernels, simplifying implementation while avoiding restrictive constraints on the parameter space. Proposition \\(\\ref{prop:proposition1}\\) states that if a stationary marginal density \\(f_X\\) that corresponds to the marginal densities of a bivariate random vector \\((U_l, V_l)\\), for all \\(l\\), can be identified, then the resulting time series is first-order strictly stationary (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2022).\nIn addition, Proposition \\(\\ref{prop:proposition1}\\) applies to continuous, discrete, or mixed distributions.\nBuilding on Proposition \\(\\ref{prop:proposition1}\\), Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) outline two general methods for constructing transition kernels: the bivariate distribution method and the conditional distribution method. The bivariate distribution method identifies a bivariate distribution of \\((U_l, V_l)\\) such that the marginal densities \\(f_{U_l}\\) and \\(f_{V_l}\\) are equal to a pre-specified stationary marginal density \\(f_X\\) for \\(l\\)th transition kernel. The conditional distribution method finds compatible conditional densities, \\(f_{U_l|V_l}\\) and \\(f_{V_l|U_l}\\), to specify the bivariate density of \\((U_l, V_l)\\) for the \\(l\\)th transition kernel.\nThe Gaussian MTD model, for example, is constructed via the bivariate distribution method. Under marginal \\(f_x(x) = N(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), the Gaussian MTD model can be constructed as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf(x_t | \\textbf{x}^{t-1}) = \\sum_{l=1}^L w_l N(x_t | (1 - \\rho_l) \\mu + \\rho_l x_{t-l}, \\sigma^2 (1 - \\rho_l^2)).\n\\end{equation}\\]",

Let \\({\\{Z_t\\}}_{t=L+1}^n\\) be the set of latent variables, where each \\(Z_t\\) has a discrete distribution with support \\(\\{1,...,L\\}\\). \\(Z_t = l\\) selects the \\(l\\)th kernel through a random mechanism that is not directly observable.

Based on the specific value of \\(z_t\\), \\(\\delta_l(z_t)\\) selects the corresponding \\(w_l\\).\nThe full Bayesian model is completed by the specification of prior distributions for the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). The priors for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) depend on the form of the kernels \\(f_l\\). For the cdf-based weights, the priors for \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\) is \\(CDP(\\boldsymbol{w} | \\alpha_0, a_0, b_0)\\).\n\n\n3.3.2 Model Estimation and Prediction\nThe posterior distribution of the parameters, based on the conditional likelihood, is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\np(\\boldsymbol{w}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, {\\{z_t\\}}_{t=L+1}^n | D_n) \\propto \\pi_w(\\boldsymbol{w}) \\prod_{l=1}^L \\pi_l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_l)\n\\prod_{t=L+1}^n \\Biggl\\{ f_{z_t} (x_t | x_{t-z_t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{z_t}) \\sum_{l=1}^L w_l \\delta_l(z_t) \\Biggl\\}.\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\(D_n = {\\{x_t\\}}_{t=L+1}^n\\) is the data. In this general framework, full simulation-based Bayesian estimation and prediction can be achieved using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\nConditioning on \\({\\{z_t\\}}_{t=L+1}^n\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\), the posterior full condition for each \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_l\\) depends on the specific form of the kernel \\(f_l\\), which will be presented in Chapter 5. Conditioning on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\), the posterior full condition of each latent variable \\(Z_t\\) is a discrete distribution on \\(\\{1, ..., L\\}\\) with probabilities proportional to \\(w_l f_l(x_t | x_{t-l}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\). Conditioning on \\({\\{z_t\\}}_{t=L+1}^n\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), the posterior full condition for \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\) depends only on \\(M_l = |\\{ t: z_t = l \\}|\\), for \\(l = 1,..., L\\), where \\(|\\{ \\cdot \\}|\\) is the carnality or the size of the set \\(\\{ \\cdot \\}\\).\nTurning to predictions for future values, the one-step-ahead posterior predictive density is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\label{eq:posteriorpredictive}\np(x_{n+1} | D_n) = \\int \\int \\Biggl\\{ \\sum_{l=1}^L w_l f_l (x_{n+1} | x_{n + 1 - l}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_l) \\Biggl\\}\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} , \\boldsymbol{w} | D_n) d \\boldsymbol{\\theta} d \\boldsymbol{w}.\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe \\(k\\)-step-ahead posterior predictive density, which incorporates the uncertainty from the parameter estimation and the predictions of the previous \\((k-1)\\) out-of-sample values, can be obtained by extending the posterior predictive density in \\(\\eqref{eq:posteriorpredictive}\\).\nOur work builds upon the MTD time series model by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) and draws inspiration from the nearest-neighbor mixture processes (NNMP) and the discrete nearest-neighbor mixture processes (DNNMP) spatial models developed by the same authors (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2023b, 2023a). The MTD model by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) includes Gaussian, Poisson, negative binomial MTD, and Lomax MTD regression models, with applications to simulated data, crime incidents and precipitation prediction. Their flexibility offers potential for broader applications. However, to satisfy Proposition \\(\\ref{prop:proposition1}\\), for certain invariant marginal distributions, the transition kernel may either require careful construction or can result in a form that is not explicitly defined or too complex. The NNMP and DNNMP models effectively use copula to model dependence and marginals separately. Building onto the class of MTD models and motivated by the class of NNMP and DNNMP models, we propose to incorporate copula-based transition kernels.

    "text": "4.1 Copula\nThe proposed MTD model extends the original MTD model by incorporating copulas into the transition kernels. By allowing dependence structures to be modeled separately from the marginal distribution, the proposed approach enables a choice of copula families that effectively capture the data’s dependence structures while allowing flexibility in marginal selection, thereby enhancing modeling capabilities and flexibility.\nThe invariant condition in Proposition \\(\\ref{prop:proposition1}\\) is achieved using the bivariate distribution approach, which specifies the stationary density \\(f_X\\) as the marginal densities of \\((U_l, V_l)\\), \\(f_{U_l}\\) and \\(f_{V_l}\\), for all \\(l\\). This is facilitated by the use of a copula, which separates the marginal behavior of the random variables from their dependence structure.\nCopula is a multivariate cumulative distribution function where its marginal distribution of each random variable follows a uniform distribution on the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Copulas are useful for modeling dependence between random variables. Copulas decompose any joint distribution \\(F\\) into two parts: the copula \\(C\\) and the marginal distributions \\(F_j\\). The theoretical groundwork for copulas is rooted in Sklar’s theorem Sklar (1959).\nIn the bivariate setting, as outlined in the bivariate distribution approach, the joint density of \\((U_l, V_l)\\) is \\(f_{U_l, V_l} (x_t, x_{t-l})\\) \\(= c(x_t, x_{t-l})\\) \\(f_{U_l}(x_t) f_{V_l}(x_{t-l})\\). By applying the law of conditional probability, the conditional density of \\(U_l\\) given \\(V_l\\) is then \\(f_{U_l | V_l}(x_t | x_{t-l}) = c(x_t, x_{t-l}) f_{U_l}(x_t) f_{V_l}(x_{t-l}) / f_{V_l}(x_{t-l})\\) \\(= c(x_t, x_{t-l}) f_{U_l}(x_t)\\). Given a pre-specified stationary marginal density \\(f_X\\), and replace \\(f_{U_l}\\) and \\(f_{V_l}\\) with \\(f_X\\), for every \\(x_t\\) and for all \\(l\\). For \\(t &gt; L\\), the proposed copula-based MTD model specifies the conditional distribution as\n\\(c_l (x_t, x_{t-l})\\) is the copula density evaluated at \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_{t-l}\\), and \\(f_X(x_t)\\) is the stationary marginal density evaluated at \\(x_t\\). Compared to \\(\\ref{eq:cond_distribution}\\), the transition kernel, \\(f_l\\), is now replaced by two components: the copula density \\(c_l\\), and the stationary marginal density \\(f_X\\). The copula captures the dependence between current and lagged value and controls the strength of the dependence through a dependence parameter. Stationary marginal density describes the marginal behavior of the current value. A variety of copula families and marginal distributions are available for choice. Without much modifications to our proposed model, the marginal distribution can take any form, but is limited to continuous distributions.\nWe consider the Gaussian copula with the dependence parameter \\(\\rho\\). A Gaussian copula for \\((X_1, X_2)\\) is \\[\\begin{equation}\n    C(u_1, u_2 |  \\rho) = \\Phi_2 (\\Phi^{-1} (u_1),  \\Phi^{-1} (u_2) | \\rho)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\(u_j = F_j(x_j)\\) are standard uniform distribution, where \\(F_j\\) is the marginal cdf of \\(X_j\\), for \\(j = 1,2\\). \\(\\Phi_2\\) is the cdf of a bivariate standard Gaussian distribution with the dependence parameter \\(\\rho \\in (-1, 1)\\), and \\(\\Phi\\) is the cdf of a univariate standard Gaussian distribution. If both \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are continuous variables, the copula has the density \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    c(\\Phi^{-1} (u_1), \\Phi^{-1} (u_2) | \\rho) = \\frac{1} {\\sqrt{(1 - \\rho^2)}} \\exp{\\Biggl( \\frac{2 \\rho \\Phi^{-1} (u_1) \\Phi^{-1} (u_2) - \\rho^2\\{ {(\\Phi^{-1} (u_1))}^2 + {(\\Phi^{-1} (u_2))}^2 \\}} {2 (1 - \\rho^2)} \\Biggr)}.\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]",

For the copula-based Gamma MTD model, the priors are specified as \\(Gamma(\\alpha | u_{\\alpha}, v_{\\alpha})\\), \\(Gamma(\\beta | u_{\\beta}, v_{\\beta})\\), and \\(Unif(\\rho_l |-1, 1)\\). For the cdf-based weights, the prior is \\(CDP(\\boldsymbol{w} | \\alpha_0, a_0, b_0)\\).\nThe parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}\\) are updated using a slice sampler (Neal 2003). Following the definition in Equation \\(\\ref{eq:cond_distribution_copula}\\), denote \\(f_l (x_t | x_{t-l})\\) as \\(f_l (x_t | x_{t-l}) = c_l (x_t, x_{t-l}) f_X(x_t)\\), where \\(f_l\\) is the transition kernel, \\(c_l\\) is the copula density, and \\(f_X\\) is the stationary marginal density.

    "text": "6.2 Simulation Results\n\n6.2.1 Convergence Diagnostics\nScenario 1 in ?tbl-scenarios serves as an example to show and track convergence and has the same setup as Scenario 1 in the original MTD studies.\nTables (?tbl-w-table-s1, ?tbl-rho-table-s1, ?tbl-mar-table-s1) present the posterior estimates and convergence diagnostics for the parameters related to weight, dependence, and marginal distribution, respectively. We defer the discussion of the estimates of the posterior mean and standard deviation (mean and SD) until a later section. There is no evidence of lack of convergence for all parameters (Gelman-Rubin statistic \\(R\\) and its upper CI \\(\\leq 1.1\\)). The simulation error of the estimates is also negligible for all parameters (Naive SE and Time-series SE are close to zero).\nGelman–Rubin convergence diagnostic and ACF plots (Figure B.1, Figure B.2, Figure B.3) can be found in the Appendix B Section B.1.1. In Scenario 1, the chains converge more rapidly for the parameters related to the marginal distribution, achieving convergence at around \\(2000\\) iterations. The chains converge more slowly for the parameters related to weight and dependence, especially at later lags. Nevertheless, all weight and dependence parameters reach convergence by \\(8000\\) iterations. Similar patterns emerge across all other scenarios. Trace and density plots (Figure B.4, Figure B.5, Figure B.6) are also included in Appendix B Section B.1.1.\n\n\n6.2.2 Weight and Dependence Parameters for Copula\nScenarios 1, 2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 in ?tbl-scenarios are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of weight and dependence construction, as well as their interplay.\nScenario 1 and 2 share the same setup as the original MTD studies, where weight and dependence are compatible. In Scenario 1, we consider exponentially decreasing weights. In Scenario 2, we consider an uneven arrangement of the relevant lags.\nWe explore additional scenarios to investigate outcomes when weight and dependence are incompatible, as well as cases where they are compatible but follow rarely observed patterns. In Scenario 1.3, we assign equal weights while preserving a decreasing dependence structure. In Scenario 1.4, we retain exponentially decreasing weights but reverse the direction of dependence. In Scenario 1.5, both weights and dependence are set to increase. In Scenario 1.6, we set both weights and dependence to be equal.\nWe first examine two cases where the weight parameters and the dependence parameters are compatible. As shown in (a), (b) of Figure 6.1, the results appear reasonable; that is, the estimates are consistent with the true values, with minor discrepancies. Nevertheless, the differences are minimal, and the \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals cover the true value for both weight and dependence across all lags.\nWe then explore additional scenarios to investigate the outcomes when they are not compatible. As shown in (c) and (d) of Figure 6.1, the results appear unusual, with some noticeable discrepancies at later lags. The \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals cover the true value for both weight and dependence for most lags.\nMoving on to the remaining cases where weights and dependence are compatible, though they follow patterns that are rarely observed in real-world settings. As shown in (e) and (f) of Figure 6.1, the results appear reasonable, with minimal discrepancies. The \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals cover the true value for both weight and dependence for most lags.\nIn these scenarios, greater weight on a lag yields narrower \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible interval (CI) for that lag, while lesser weight results in wider CI. If more weight is placed on a lag, it contributes more to the current value. This increased contribution provides the model with more information to estimate its influence, resulting in narrower CI. Conversely, with less information available to estimate its influence, the CI widens and approaches the prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: (a), (b) Results for Scenarios 1 and 1.2: default setup; (c), (d) Scenarios 1.3 and 1.4: incompatible weight and dependence; (e), (f) Scenarios 1.5 and 1.6: compatible, but rarely observed patterns. (Left) Dashed lines are true weights, dot-dashed lines are prior means, solid lines are posterior means, and polygons are \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals. (Right) Dashed (black) lines are true dependence, dot-dashed (red) lines are prior means, solid (blue) lines are posterior means, and (purple) polygons are \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Parameters for Marginal Distributions\nScenario 3 to 6 in ?tbl-scenarios are used to evaluate the shape and the rate parameter for the gamma marginal distribution. Scenario 7 through 9 are used to evaluate these parameters in cases with high skewness.\nIn Scenario 3 to 9, we revert to the same settings for weight and dependence as used in Scenario 1. That is, we fix \\(w_i \\propto \\exp(-i), i = 1,..., 5\\) and \\(\\rho_l = (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1)\\).\nThe slice sampler may encounter difficulties when the target distribution is not evaluable. In particular, skewness of the target distribution may reduce the efficiency of the slice sampler by inducing correlations between successive samples (Planas and Rossi 2024). To investigate this effect, we explore additional scenarios to identify where the algorithm may fail, focusing on Scenarios 7 through 9, which exhibit increasing skewness and are highlighted in Figure 4.1.\nAs shown in ?tbl-mar-table-s3456, the results appear reasonable; that is, convergence has been achieved and the estimates are consistent with the true values. As shown in ?tbl-mar-table-s789, the results also appear reasonable. Additional plots (Figure B.7, Figure B.8) can be found in the Appendix B Section B.1.3.\n\n\n6.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis\nFor the prior sensitivity analysis, we re-run Scenario 1 using five different sets of priors. ?tbl-prior-analysis presents the setups and descriptions of these prior specifications. Figure 6.2 illustrates some examlples.\nResults appear reasonable, and the estimates are consistent with the true values, indicating that the model is robust to the choice of prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Examples of Prior Distributions for Scenario 1: (a) Priors for \\(\\alpha\\), with the true value equal to \\(7\\), and (b) priors for \\(\\beta\\), with the true value equal to \\(1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Coverage Assessment\nTo compute coverage rates, for each of the \\(40\\) replicates, we first combine the four chains of \\(8000\\) posterior samples per parameter, then calculate the \\(95\\%\\) credible interval from the combined samples, and record whether the true parameter value falls within this interval. The overall coverage is the proportion of replicates in which the true value is contained within the interval.\nAs shown in Tables (?tbl-coverage-1 and ?tbl-coverage-2), the \\(95\\%\\) credible intervals for all parameters successfully contain the true values in most replicates across both scenarios. Most parameters achieve full coverage, with a few slightly below \\(1\\), indicating that the credible intervals reliably capture the true parameter values. Importantly, the lengths of the credible intervals vary across parameters, reflecting differences in estimation uncertainty. Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4 show these intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Coverage Rates for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) Across 40 Replicates for Scenario 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Coverage Rates for \\(w\\) and \\(\\rho\\) Across 40 Replicates for Scenario 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanas, Christophe, and Alessandro Rossi. 2024. “The Slice Sampler and Centrally Symmetric Distributions.” Monte Carlo Methods and Applications 30 (3): 299–313.",

We also present the algorithms and simulation studies, which demonstrate promising results across various scenarios. The advantage of our proposed approach is that, by incorporating copulas into the existing MTD models, the dependence structure and the marginal distribution can be modeled separately, allowing the marginal distribution to be any continuous form.\nIn real-world settings, some data exhibit zero-inflation and requires modeling with a mixture model with a point mass at zero. For example, medical costs, insurance claims, precipitation amounts, as well as transportation safety measures such as lane departure severity scores (Mills 2013) and vehicle deceleration during braking (Feng 2020). Failure to address these issues undermines model robustness and results. Furthermore, the copula approach may encounter issues when handling a large number of zeros. In such case, the marginal distribution needs to be re-constructed. This motivates the methodological developments introduced in Part II, where we develope a model that addresses the issues of zero-inflation.\nMoreover, a previous study (Hassan 2021) found comparable predictive performance for disease spread between the probabilistic MTD model and the deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We aim to compare our approach to this alternative method. This comparative analysis is presented in Part III, where we compare the performance of our proposed MTD models against the LSTMs through simulation studies and real-world data applications.\n\n\n\n\nFeng, Tianshu. 2020.

    "text": "Zero-inflated data are characterized by an excess of zero values. In these data types, observations often feature a point mass at zero, followed by values from a separate distribution that can be discrete, continuous, or otherwise non-zero. Zero-inflated count data frequently occur in a wide range of domains, including finance, economics, healthcare, transportation, and ecology. While zero-inflated count data have been studied extensively, zero-inflated continuous, or semicontinuous, data also arise frequently in practice. Examples of semicontinuous data are medical expenditures (Duan et al. 1983; Neelon, Zhu, and Neelon 2015; Neelon, O’Malley, and Smith 2016a, 2016b; Liu et al. 2019), insurance claims (Shi and Yang 2018; Yang 2022), precipitation amounts (Hyndman and Grunwald 2000; Abraham and Tan 2009; Dzupire, Ngare, and Odongo 2018; Kaewprasert, Niwitpong, and Niwitpong 2024), lane departure severity scores (Mills 2013), and vehicle deceleration during braking (Feng 2020).\nThere are two classes of models designed to handle data with excessive zeros: two-component, zero-inflated (ZI) models (Lambert 1992) and two-part, hurdle models (Mullahy 1986). Both models employ a mixture of a binary component modeling zeros and a separate component modeling non-zero values, which can be either count or continuous. The key distinction lies in the source of zeros. In ZI models, zeros may arise from both the binary and non-zero components, whereas in hurdle models, zeros occur exclusively in the binary component, with the non-zero component restricted to non-zero values.\nBuilding upon the architecture of the MTD model introduced in 2022 by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022), in Part I we proposed the copula-based Gamma MTD model, which enables flexible dependence modeling and accommodates arbitrary continuous marginals, thereby enhancing modeling capabilities and flexibility. However, while this framework addresses the challenge of constructing a flexible transition kernel for non-Gaussian marginal distributions, it remains limited in handling excessive zeros commonly observed in real-world continuous data.\nTo address this limitation, we propose reconstructing the marginal distribution to account for zero-inflation. Our approach is similar to hurdle models in that it models zero and non-zero values separately. Unlike hurdle models, however, it applies a soft threshold that replaces zeros with small non-zero values rather than generating exact zeros. Building on the continuous extension (CE) approach (Denuit and Lambert 2005), this technique transforms zero-inflated marginal distributions into continuous distributions, thereby mitigating the identifiability issues that copulas face when modeling discrete or mixed marginals (Genest and Nešlehová 2007). This CE-based reformulation enables copulas to effectively capture complex dependence while accurately modeling zero-inflated continuous marginals. The proposed copula-based zero-inflated MTD model extends the copula-based MTD model by accommodating zero-inflation, thereby enhancing its applicability and flexibility for handling mixed data with excess zeros.\nThe rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We review several zero-inflated (ZI) count and continuous models for dependent data, as well as the continuous extension (CE) approach in Chapter 10. We present the proposed model in Chapter 11 and provide an overview of the MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation in Chapter 12. We present the results of various simulations conducted to assess the accuracy and performance of the proposed model in Chapter 13 and discuss the model’s predictive capabilities, including uncertainty quantification, in Chapter 14. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Chapter 15.

    "text": "10.1 Zero-Inflated Count Models\nIn this section, we discuss existing approaches and a related framework that forms the basis of our proposed method. We first review the zero-inflated count and zero-inflated continuous models, which are widely used for handling zero-inflated data. We then introduce the continuous extension (CE) approach, an existing framework that has been applied to zero-inflated continuous data in spatial contexts, but not previously to our specific problem setting.\nZero-inflated count data are prevalent across diverse domains such as finance, economics, healthcare, transportation, and ecology. Examples include claim frequencies in automobile insurance (Chowdhury et al. 2019; Zhang, Pitt, and Wu 2022; Bermúdez and Karlis 2022; Simmachan and Boonkrong 2024; Slime et al. 2025), the number of business service firms within an airport economic zone (Jiang et al. 2018), the frequency of medical service use (Pizer and Prentice 2011; Chatterjee et al. 2018), crash counts or accident frequencies (Dong et al. 2014; Hao, Ya-dong, and Yong 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Mathew and Benekohal 2021), and species abundances (Martin et al. 2005).\nAccordingly, there is a rich literature on zero-inflated count models in these domains. For a comprehensive review of zero-inflated count regression models, as well as zero-inflated count time series, spatial, and multivariate models, we refer the reader to Young, Roemmele, and Yeh (2022) and Young, Roemmele, and Shi (2022), respectively.\nOur primary goal is to develop models for zero-inflated continuous time series data. To provide a foundation for this discussion, we review two zero-inflated count time series models in the next section.",

    "section": "10.2 Zero-Inflated Count Models for Dependent Data",
    "text": "10.2 Zero-Inflated Count Models for Dependent Data\n\n10.2.1 State Space Models\nYang, Cavanaugh, and Zamba (2015) propose a state space or dynamic model for zero-inflated count time series. Feng (2020) extends this framework to continuous-valued zero-inflated time series, resulting in the development of the dynamic semi-continuous zero-inflated (DSCZI) model.\nBoth the dynamic model and the MTD model include a latent state and can be classified as state space models. However, they differ in how they capture time dependence. In particular, the dynamic model introduces a continuous latent process that evolves over time according to a autoregressive (AR) process of order \\(p\\), which can be equivalently represented as a \\(p\\)-dimentional AR(\\(1\\)) process. In contrast, the MTD framework represents time dependence via a set of discrete latent variables, each selecting a lag-specific kernel among \\(L\\) kernels. These latent variables determine which lag-specific kernel governs the current state through a random but non-dynamically evolving mechanism. As a result, while the dynamic model represents temporal evolution via a continuous, hidden state process, the MTD model captures time dependence through the dynamics embedded in the lag-specific kernels, with selection governed by a set of discrete, static latent variables.\nWhile the standard MTD framework assumes latent variables are independent across time, some MTD variants incorporate a dynamic latent state that evolves over time, governing by a temporal process. For example, Bartolucci and Farcomeni (2010) propose a model in which the discrete latent variables follow a hidden Markov chain and note that further generalizations, though possible, often result in models with a large number of parameters and require computationally intensive algorithms for fitting. In addition, Yang, Cavanaugh, and Zamba (2015) relies on an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for estimation, but with the advancement of modern computing, they suggest a full Bayesian framework using a MCMC approach for future work. In contrast, the MTD model already implements a full Bayesian framework using MCMC, allowing for efficient posterior inference.\n\n\n10.2.2 Copula-Based Markov Models\nAlqawba, Diawara, and Rao Chaganty (2019) and Alqawba and Diawara (2021) propose the copula-based Markov zero-inflated count time series model, utilizing marginal distributions such as the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), and zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (ZICMP).\nSimilarly, the MTD and NNMP models, discussed in Chapter 3, belong to the class of first-order Markov models. However, copulas were not incorporated into these frameworks until the later work of Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023b) and Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023a). Even then, in the discrete spatial NNMP models, Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023a) utilize copulas in a different manner. More specifically, Alqawba, Diawara, and Rao Chaganty (2019) and Alqawba and Diawara (2021) directly compute the joint PMF of \\((X_t, X_{t-1})\\) and express it using a copula function adapted for discrete variables, from which the conditional probability is obtained by dividing by the marginal of \\(x_{t-1}\\). In contrast, Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023a) adopt the continuous extension approach, associating each discrete variable with a continuous variable. This enables the direct use of copulas in a continuous setting to construct the transition kernel in a structured mixture. Once the continuous variables are introduced, the conditional probability is specified as a mixture over \\(L\\) transition kernels, each constructed from the bivariate random vector \\((U_l, V_l)\\), with the dependence between \\(U_l\\) and \\(V_l\\) captured by a copula function.\nAlthough copula-based Markov models have been widely applied to count and zero-inflated count data in both time series and spatial contexts, their application to zero-inflated continuous data remains largely unexplored.",

    "section": "10.3 Zero-Inflated Continuous models",
    "text": "10.3 Zero-Inflated Continuous models\nZero-inflated continuous data frequently appear in domains such as healthcare, insurance, environment, and transportation. While existing literature has primarily focused on zero-inflated count data, there has been relatively less attention given to zero-inflated continuous data. Nevertheless, these studies suggest promising potential for broader applications. For example, Mills (2013) conducts two-part tests for zero-inflated Gamma (ZIG) and zero-inflated log-normal (ZILN) models and applies them to assess driving risk in individuals with neurological conditions. Zhou, Kang, and Song (2020) develope a two-part hidden Markov model and apply it to analyze data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to enhance prognosis and support early treatment. Feng (2020) applies a dynamic semi-continuous zero-inflated (DSCZI) time series model to analyze adaptive cruise control data to investigate drivers’ braking behavior, informing the in-vehicle assistance design. Sun (2020) compares the spatial Gaussian copula model with the kriging and the spatial random forests for zero-inflated forestry inventory prediction, crucial for ecosystem management. More recently, Kaewprasert, Niwitpong, and Niwitpong (2022) and Kaewprasert, Niwitpong, and Niwitpong (2024) construct Bayesian and fiducial intervals and apply them to rainfall data from northern Thailand, informing the design of disaster warning systems. Zou and Young (2024) construct fiducial-based intervals for the ZIG distribution and apply them to lipid profiles in a lung cancer study, enhancing screening and staging accuracy.\nThe DSCZI model by Feng (2020) is built based on the dynamic framework by Yang, Cavanaugh, and Zamba (2015), as discussed in Section 10.2. Conditioning on the latent state, the model uses logistic regression to model the zero values and a Gamma distribution for the positive responses. For parameter estimation, the DSCZI model utilizes the data cloning method (Lele, Dennis, and Lutscher 2007; Lele, Nadeem, and Schmuland 2010; Al-Wahsh and Hussein 2019), which leverages Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to approximate maximum likelihood estimates, avoiding gradient-based methods due to the intractable marginal likelihood and latent variable complexity.\nAlthough data cloning provides a practical approach for intractable likelihoods and is robust to the choice of prior distributions, it can be computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of the number of clones (Lele, Dennis, and Lutscher 2007). Moreover, convergence diagnostics can be challenging, and identifiability issues may persist even after cloning (Lele, Dennis, and Lutscher 2007). In contrast, MCMC draws samples from the full posterior distribution, providing a more comprehensive quantification of parameter uncertainty.",

    "section": "10.4 The Continuous Extension Approach",
    "text": "10.4 The Continuous Extension Approach\nThe continuous extension (CE) approach was first proposed by Denuit and Lambert (2005). Under the CE framework, Madsen (2009) introduces a discrete spatial Gaussian copula regresion model and applies it to the Japanese beetle grub data, while Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2023a) develop a discrete spatial copula NNMP regression model to study North American Breeding Bird Survey data. Using this approach, each discrete random variable, \\(Y_i\\), is associated with a continuous variable, \\(Y_i^*\\), defined as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nY_i^* = Y_i - U_i,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(U_i\\) follows a continuous uniform distribution on \\((0, 1)\\), independent of both \\(Y_i\\) and \\(U_j\\), for \\(i \\neq j\\). The resulting \\(Y_i^*\\) is a continuous random variable. Not only does this continuous extension of \\(Y_i\\) preserves all information, but \\(Y^*_i\\) and \\(Y^*_j\\) also retain the dependence structure of \\(Y_i\\) and \\(Y_j\\), as shown by Denuit and Lambert (2005).\nOur work once again builds upon the MTD time series model by Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó (2022) and draws inspiration from the NNMP and the discrete NNMP spatial models developed by the same authors (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2023b, 2023a). Additional motivation comes from the work of Monleon, Madsen, and Wilson (2019) and Sun (2020), which extend the spatial Gaussian copula model of Madsen (2009) by adapting the CE approach for zero-inflated continuous data. Building onto these models, we propose to reconstruct the marginal distribution to accomondate for zero-inflation.

    "text": "11.1 Copula\nThe proposed model extends the copula-based Gamma MTD model to handle zero-inflated data by reconstructing the marginal distribution. By transforming semi-continuous distributions into continuous distributions, the proposed approach addresses the issues encountered with non-continuity in the copula model, thus maintaining the same effectiveness and flexibility in modeling dependence structures as described in Chapter 4.\nAs stated in Definition \\(\\ref{def:copula}\\), if \\(X_j\\) is continuous for all \\(j\\), then copula function \\(C\\) is unique and differentiable. The joint probability density function of \\(X_j\\), \\(f(x_j)\\), can be factored into the product of the copula density, \\(c\\), and the density of \\(X_j\\), \\(f_j\\), \\(j=1,...,p\\). However, in the case of zero-inflated gamma distribution, \\(X_j\\) is semi-continuous, i.e., it exhibits a point mass at zero combined with a continuous distribution over positive values.\nBuilding on the CE framework for discrete values, zero values are replaced with non-zero values drawn from a continuous uniform distribution. The resulting distribution is continuous, effectively smoothing the zero values while preserving the overall distributional structure, including its dependence structure. We defer the details of the marginal distribution reconstruction to Section 11.2.\nWe use an asterisk (\\(*\\)) to denote that a density is CE-based. Without the asterisk, the notation corresponds to the Gamma MTD model introduced in Part I. Based on a pre-specified stationary marginal density \\(f^*_X\\), we define copulas \\(C^*_l = C_l\\) over continuous random vectors \\((U^*_l, V^*_l)\\), with marginals \\(f_{U^*_l} = f^*_X\\) and \\(f_{V^*_l} = f^*_X\\), analogous to copulas in the Gamma MTD model. For \\(t &gt; L\\), the proposed copula-based zero-inflated Gamma MTD (ZIGamma MTD) model specifies the conditional distribution in the same form as given in \\(\\eqref{eq:cond_distribution_copula}\\) in Chapter 4.\nAs before, a variety of copula families are available, and the proposed model can be readily extended by reconstructing the zero-inflated continuous marginal distribution in a similar manner, provided that the resulting distribution remains within the class of continuous distributions.\nWe consider the Gaussian copula with the dependence parameter \\(\\rho\\), as described in Section 4.1. As previously noted, while the marginal distributions can be arbitrary, they are required to be continuous. In the subsequent section, we outline a technique to transform semi-continuous distributions into continuous distributions.",

The shifted Gamma distribution, \\(\\text{ShiftedGamma}(\\mu, \\beta; \\epsilon)\\), is a standard Gamma distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and scale \\(\\beta\\) that is shifted to the right by \\(\\epsilon\\), with the support \\([\\epsilon, \\infty)\\). It is expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf(y; \\mu, \\beta, \\epsilon) =\n\\frac{1} {\\Gamma(\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}) \\beta^{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}}} {(y - \\epsilon)}^{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta} - 1} \\exp(- \\frac{y - \\epsilon} {\\beta}) \\quad y \\geq \\epsilon,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta} &gt; 0\\) denotes the shape, \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\) the scale, and \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\) the threshold parameter.\nFigure 11.1 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the zero-inflated gamma distribution, along with the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) for fixing the parameters \\(\\mu = 7\\) and \\(\\beta = 1\\), while varying the parameters \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(P\\) (\\(\\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4\\); \\(P = 0.1, 0.5, 0.7\\)). Each row of the figure corresponds to a different value of \\(P\\): \\(P = 0.1\\), \\(0.5\\), and \\(0.7\\) from top to bottom. Within each row, plot (a) shows the case for \\(\\epsilon = 0.1\\), with the left and right panels depicting the PDF and CDF, respectively. Plot (b) shows the corresponding curves for \\(\\epsilon = 0.4\\).\nAs also shown in the right panels in Figure 11.1, the CDF is continuous and no longer exhibits a point mass at zero, i.e., there is no longer a discontinuous jump at zero. Comparing the left and right panels we can see parameter \\(\\epsilon\\) controls the degree of the slope near the origin, where smaller value of \\(\\epsilon\\) results in steep increase in the CDF, while larger value leads to a more gradual increase. Comparing left panels from top (\\(P = 0.1\\)) to bottom (\\(P = 0.7\\)) we see the contribution of the shifted gamma distribution decreases as \\(P\\) increases. In other words, zero values become increasingly dominant over positive values with higher \\(P\\). Additional plots are provided in the Appendix A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: (a), (b): \\(ZIGamma(\\mu = 7, \\beta = 1, P = 0.1, \\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4)\\); (c), (d): \\(ZIGamma(\\mu = 7, \\beta = 1, P = 0.5, \\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4)\\); (e), (f): \\(ZIGamma(\\mu = 7, \\beta = 1, P = 0.7, \\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4)\\).

For example, one could construct a Gaussian copula with a zero-inflated log-normal (ZILN) MTD model or a Gumble copula with a zero-inflated Gamma (ZIGamma) MTD model, among other configurations.

    "text": "13.2 Simulation Results\n\n13.2.1 Convergence Diagnostics\nScenario 1 in ?tbl-scenarios-zigamma serves as an example to show and track convergence and has the same setup for \\(w\\) and \\(\\rho\\) as Scenario 1 in the original MTD studies.\nTables (?tbl-w-table-s1-zigamma, ?tbl-rho-table-s1-zigamma, ?tbl-mar-table-s1-zigamma) present the posterior estimates and convergence diagnostics for the parameters related to weight, dependence, and marginal distribution, respectively. We defer the discussion of the estimates of the posterior mean and standard deviation (mean and SD) until a later section. There is no evidence of lack of convergence for all parameters (Gelman-Rubin statistic \\(R\\) and its upper CI \\(\\leq 1.1\\)). The simulation error of the estimates is also negligible for all parameters (Naive SE and Time-series SE are close to zero).\nGelman–Rubin convergence diagnostic and ACF plots (Figure C.1, Figure C.2, Figure C.3) can be found in Appendix C Section C.1.1. In Scenario 1, the chains converge more rapidly for the parameters related to the marginal distribution, achieving convergence at around \\(2000\\) iterations. The chains converge more slowly for the parameters related to weight and dependence, especially at later lags. Nevertheless, all weight and dependence parameters reach convergence by \\(8000\\) iterations. Similar patterns emerge across all other scenarios. Trace and density plots (Figure C.4, Figure C.5, Figure C.6) are also included in Appendix C Section C.1.1.\n\n\n13.2.2 Weight and Dependence Parameters for Copula\nScenarios 1 and 2 in ?tbl-scenarios-zigamma are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of weight and dependence construction, as well as their interplay.\nScenario 1 and 2 share the same setup for \\(w\\) and \\(\\rho\\) as the original MTD studies, where weight and dependence are compatible. In Scenario 1, we consider exponentially decreasing weights. In Scenario 2, we consider an uneven arrangement of the relevant lags.\nAs shown in (a), (b) of Figure 13.1, the results appear reasonable; that is, the estimates are consistent with the true values, with minor discrepancies. Nevertheless, the differences are minimal, and the \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals cover the true value for both weight and dependence across all lags.\nConsistent with the results of the Gamma MTD model, placing greater weight on a lag yields narrower \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible interval (CI) for that lag. When less information is available to estimate its influence, the CI widens and approaches the prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: (a), (b) Results for Scenarios 1 and 2: default setup for \\(w\\) and \\(\\rho\\) (\\(P = 0.1\\) and \\(\\epsilon = 0.1\\)). (Left) Dashed (black) lines are true weights, dot-dashed (red) lines are prior means, solid lines are posterior means, and (purple) polygons are \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals. (Right) Dashed (black) lines are true dependence, dot-dashed (red) lines are prior means, solid (blue) lines are posterior means, and (purple) polygons are \\(95\\%\\) posterior credible intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Parameters for Marginal Distributions\nScenario 3 to 6 in ?tbl-scenarios-zigamma are used to evaluate the mean and the scale parameter for the zero-inflated gamma marginal distribution. Scenario 7 through 9 are used to evaluate these parameters in cases with high skewness.\nIn Scenario 3 to 9, we revert to the same settings for weight and dependence as used in Scenario 1. That is, we fix \\(w_i \\propto \\exp(-i), i = 1,..., 5\\) and \\(\\rho_l = (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1)\\).\nFor the ZIGamma MTD model, the slice sampler faces similar challenges when the target distribution is not evaluable. Skewness of the target distribution may reduce sampling efficiency by inducing correlations between successive draws (Planas and Rossi 2024). To investigate this effect, we explore additional scenarios to identify where the algorithm may fail, focusing on Scenarios 7 through 9, which exhibit increasing skewness similar to that illustrated in Figure 4.1.\nWe present the results of Scenario 3 and Scenario 7 as examples. Each scenario consists of six cases, covering all combinations of \\(P = 0.1, 0.5, 0.7\\), and \\(\\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4\\). As shown in Tables (?tbl-mar-table-s3-zigamma, ?tbl-mar-table-s7-zigamma), the results appear reasonable; that is, convergence has been achieved and the estimates are consistent with the true values.\nTo demonstrate how plots showing the marginal results for the Gamma MTD model in Appendix B Section B.1.3 can be generated for the ZIGamma MTD model, we include example plots for Scenario 1 in Appendix C Section C.1.3: the simulated data in Figure C.7 and the results overlaid on the simulated data in Figure C.8.\n\n\n13.2.4 Coverage Assessment\nTo compute coverage rates, for each of the \\(40\\) replicates, we first combine the four chains of \\(8000\\) posterior samples per parameter, then calculate the \\(95\\%\\) credible interval from the combined samples, and record whether the true parameter value falls within this interval. The overall coverage is the proportion of replicates for which the true value is contained within the interval.\nAs shown in Tables (?tbl-coverage-1-zigamma and ?tbl-coverage-2-zigamma), the \\(95\\%\\) credible intervals for all parameters successfully contain the true values in most replicates across both scenarios. Most parameters achieve full coverage, with a few slightly below \\(1\\), indicating that the credible intervals reliably capture the true parameter values. Importantly, the lengths of the credible intervals vary across parameters, reflecting differences in estimation uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\nPlanas, Christophe, and Alessandro Rossi. 2024. “The Slice Sampler and Centrally Symmetric Distributions.” Monte Carlo Methods and Applications 30 (3): 299–313.",

To provide a clearer picture, we decompose the coverage into below (i.e., the coverage for values less than or equal to \\(\\epsilon\\)) and above (i.e., the coverage for values greater than \\(\\epsilon\\)). As shown in these tables, when the zero-inflated probability is low (e.g., \\(P = 0.1\\)), the empirical coverage above is a more informative metric for assessing predictive performance.

    "text": "In this part of the dissertation, we review existing models for zero-inflated dependent count and continuous data, as well as the continuous extension approach, and propose a novel copula-based zero-inflated MTD model that extends the existing framework. We also present the algorithms and simulation studies, which demonstrate promising results across various scenarios. The advantage of our proposed approach is that, by reconstructing semi-continuous distributions into continuous forms, it preserves the effectiveness of copula modeling for capturing dependence structures, while retaining flexibility in the selection of marginal distributions in zero-inflated continuous settings.\nWe treat the threshold parameter as a variable rather than fixing it. The threshold is a nuanced parameter that can influence model outcome, and fixing it arbitrarily might overlook important variations in performance. Future work could include a sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the threshold affect model performance.\nIn real-world settings, dependence structures often exhibit features such as tail dependence or asymmetry that cannot be adequately captured by the Gaussian copula. Further research should explore alternative copula families, such as the Clayton or Gumbel copulas, along with efficient estimation techniques and practical applications, to better capture complex dependence patterns in empirical data.\nAlthough the framework can be readily extended to handle non-stationary time series and incorporate predictors (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2022), these features are not currently implemented. Consequently, it cannot adequately model non-stationary data with trends and seasonality, limiting its practical effectiveness. In addition, the lack of support for covariate prevents the model from jointly capturing the effects of past observations and relevant covariate. A key future direction is to extend the framework for non-stationary and regression-based settings. Such an extension would enable the model to handle changing dynamics and incorporate both sources of information, thereby improving its flexibility and applicability to real-world data.\nFinally, we use MCMC as our primary sampling method, but alternative approaches such as Variational Inference or Sequential Monte Carlo could also be explored. These alternatives offer different trade-offs between computational efficiency and approximation accuracy. Future work could involve a comparison of these methods to assess how the choice of sampling strategy impacts model performance.\n\n\n\n\nZheng, Xiaotian, Athanasios Kottas, and Bruno Sansó. 2022. “On Construction and Estimation of Stationary Mixture Transition Distribution Models.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 31 (1): 283–93.",

    "text": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986), and their variants, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), are widely used for modeling sequence data because of their ability to capture both short- and long-term dependencies. In natural language processing, they have been successfully applied to tasks such as handwriting recognition (Graves et al. 2008), language modeling (Mikolov 2012), speech recognition (Chan et al. 2015; Chiu et al. 2017), and machine translation (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014; Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014). Beyond language, RNNs and LSTMs have also shown effective in complex time series forecasting and have been employed for applications including financial market prediction (Siami-Namini, Tavakoli, and Namin 2019; Muncharaz 2020; Pirani et al. 2022), energy forecasting (Manero, Béjar, and Cortés 2018; Sandhu, Nair, et al. 2019; Yu, Cao, and Zhu 2019; Paramasivan 2021), weather and climate modeling (Salman et al. 2018; Haq 2022), and epidemiological trend analysis (Chimmula and Zhang 2020; Wang et al. 2020).\nHowever, previous studies comparing LSTMs to traditional models often claim LSTM superiority, a conclusion that can be misleading when the benchmarks chosen are inappropriate. For example, LSTMs are frequently compared to autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, even when the assumptions underlying ARIMA models such as stationarity and normally distributed errors are not satisfied (Hewamalage, Ackermann, and Bergmeir 2023). An early survey also reported mixed results, showing that RNNs including LSTMs outperform classical benchmarks on some datasets and metrics, but not consistently (Hewamalage, Bergmeir, and Bandara 2021). Similar concerns have also been raised in discussions of newer foundation-model approaches (Bergmeir 2024). These observations highlight the need to evaluate deep learning models against more flexible probabilistic alternatives.\nIn line with this, both probabilistic and deep learning models have been shown to be effective for forecasting univariate time series. For example, a prior study (Hassan 2021) demonstrated that the probabilistic MTD model and the deep learning LSTM network achieved similar predictive accuracy in modeling disease spread, with both slightly outperforming classical ARIMA models. These findings suggest that both probabilistic and deep learning approaches hold promise, yet their relative strengths under varying data conditions remain underexplored in the univariate setting within the statistics and machine learning (ML) literature.\nTo address the concerns about benchmark limitations and to investigate the relative performance of probabilistic and deep learning models, we conduct a rigorous comparison of LSTM and MTD models in the univariate setting. Unlike prior work that benchmarks LSTMs primarily against mis-specified linear models such as ARIMA, we evaluate LSTM against a probabilistic alternative that does not require restrictive assumptions and is better suited to non-linear, non-Gaussian dynamics. Our controlled simulations focus on stationary but non-Gaussian data-generating processes, systematically varying conditions such as marginal skewness, dependency structure, and zero-inflation to assess each model’s strengths and weaknesses. We then complement these simulations with a real-world data application to provide a grounded assessment of practical forecasting performance.\nThe rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We review RNN and LSTM architectures and their foundational concepts, and provide an overview of training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics in Chapter 17. Simulation results comparing MTDs and LSTMs are presented in Chapter 18, followed by results from the real-world data application in Chapter 19.

    "text": "17.1.1 Recurrent Unit\nAn Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is composed of repeating cells or units that unfold or unroll over time, where each unit passes recurrent information stored in the hidden state from one time step to the next. Figure 17.1 presents a visual representation of an RNN unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: Architecture of an RNN unit, reproduced from Olah (2015). \\(x_t\\) is the input, \\(h_t\\) is the hidden state, and \\(o_t\\) is the output. \\(tanh\\) is the activation function, squashing values to \\((-1, 1)\\) for stability and zero-centered output.\n\n\n\nAn RNN unit computes a weighted combination of input data, \\(x_t\\), and the previous hidden state, \\(h_{t-1}\\), applies an activation function, and updates the hidden state to \\(h_t\\). Let \\(x_t\\), \\(h_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) denote the input data, the hidden state, and the output at time \\(t\\), respectively. Then, an RNN unit can be expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\label{eq:rnn}\nh_t &= f(W_{ih} h_{t-1} + W_{ix} x_t + b_i), \\\\\no_t &= g(W_{oh} \\cdot h_t + b_o),\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(W_{ix}\\), \\(W_{ih}\\) and \\(W_{oh}\\) denote the weight matrices, and \\(b_i\\) and \\(b_o\\) the bias vectors. The subscripts \\(i\\) and \\(o\\) indicate their steps in RNN: \\(i\\) refer to the input/hidden step (first line in \\(\\eqref{eq:rnn}\\)), and \\(o\\) to the output step (second line in \\(\\eqref{eq:rnn}\\)). \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) denote the activation functions for the hidden layer and output layer, respectively. \\(f\\) is typically set to the logistic sigmoid function, denoted as \\(\\sigma\\), which outputs values in range \\((0, 1)\\) to act as a gate that controls how much information passes through. \\(g\\) is the hyperbolic tangent function, denoted as \\(tanh\\), which outputs values in range \\((-1, 1)\\) to generate output in a stable, zero-centered range.\n\n\n17.1.2 Problems with Long-Term Dependence\nWhen trained on long sequences, RNNs are prone to the well-documented vanishing gradient issue (Bengio, Simard, and Frasconi 1994). Both vanishing and exploding issues can introduce instability during training and hinder the ability of standard RNNs to capture long-term dependence in sequence data. In the vanishing case, gradients become too small to effectively update network weights, while in the exploding case, gradients grow excessively large, leading to unstable weight updates.\nTo capture long-term dependence in sequence data while alleviating the vanishing gradient problem, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) introduce the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit. Since this introduction, several LSTM variants have been developed. Notable variants include LSTM with a forget gate (Gers, Schmidhuber, and Cummins 2000), LSTM with peephole connections (Gers and Schmidhuber 2000), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Cho et al. 2014).\nWhile LSTMs effectively address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies, recent advances in sequence modeling have introduced transformer-based foundation models, which approach the problem with a fundamentally different architecture.\n\n\n17.1.3 A Note on Foundation Models such as Transformers\nFoundation models, or large pre-trained models, are general-purpose AI systems trained on large, diverse datasets to learn broad patterns before fine-tuning on specific tasks. This pretraining framework has enabled their widespread adoption across domains. Their rise followed the success of large language models like BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020). Typically built on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017), these models have excelled in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, with extensions to multi-modal and reinforcement learning. Recently, foundation models have been increasingly applied to forecasting tasks, particularly in time series analysis. Notable domain-specific models include TimeGPT-1 by Nixtla (Garza, Challu, and Mergenthaler-Canseco 2024), Lag-Llama (Rasul et al. 2024), TimesFM by Google Research (Das et al. 2024), Tiny Time Mixers by IBM Research (Ekambaram et al. 2024), Moirai by Salesforce (Woo et al. 2024), and Chronos by Amazon Web Services(Ansari et al. 2024).\nThese trends highlight the growing preference for transformer architectures in sequence modeling. Unlike RNNs and LSTMs, which process data sequentially via BPTT, transformers leverage multi-head attention with positional encoding to capture dependencies in parallel. Recurrent units are replaced with stacked encoder and decoder layers, each followed by feed-forward neural network layers, resulting in improved training efficiency and stability. For an overview of the transformer architecture and its applications in time series forecasting, see Ahmed et al. (2023). For a comprehensive survey of foundation models, see Liang et al. (2024).\nAs with many deep learning architectures, transformer-based models require large datasets to train effectively and are prone to overfitting, whereas simpler architectures like LSTMs often perform well on smaller datasets, offering easier training and tuning for practical forecasting tasks. Developing robust and interpretable transformer architectures remains a challenge, and benchmarking issues persist (Hewamalage, Ackermann, and Bergmeir 2023; Bergmeir 2024). Nonetheless, transformers hold strong potential for advancing areas of ML, including time series forecasting.\nDespite the emergence of transformer-based models, LSTMs remain a practical and effective choice for our experiments, and our discussion focus on the LSTM architecture with a forget gate (Gers, Schmidhuber, and Cummins 2000). We distinguish between two related decisions: the choice of LSTM variant and the choice of network architecture.\nFirst, we select the LSTM with a forget gate because it is the version that is implemented in PyTorch, a widely used framework for deep learning research and development. Furthermore, while several variants of the vanilla LSTM exist, such as the LSTM with peephole connections (Gers and Schmidhuber 2000) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Cho et al. 2014), a comprehensive study has shown that these variants generally offer comparable performance (Greff et al. 2016). For a comprehensive list of vanilla LSTM variants, we refer the reader to Yu et al. (2019) and Hewamalage, Bergmeir, and Bandara (2021).\nSecond, we choose LSTMs over transformer-based architectures because LSTMs are better suited for smaller datasets, require fewer computational resources, and are easier to train and tune. In contrast, transformer-based foundation models often demand much larger datasets and substantial computing power to perform optimally, making LSTMs a more practical choice for our forecasting experiments. Moreover, LSTMs provide a simpler foundation for sequence modeling, forming the conceptual basis for transformer architectures. By starting with LSTMs, we gain more control over the training process and a clearer understanding of model behavior.",

    "text": "17.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network Architecture\n\n17.2.1 LSTM Units\nAn Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit extends an RNN by introducing a cell state and three gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. The cell state carries long-term dependence, while the hidden state encodes short-term patterns. The gates regulate the flow of information by determining how much of the previous cell state should be forgotten, how much new information should be added, and how much of the updated cell state should be passed to the hidden state at each time step. Figure 17.2 presents a visual representation of an LSTM unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Architecture of an LSTM unit with a forget gate, reproduced from Olah (2015). \\(x_t\\) is the input, \\(h_t\\) the hidden state, and \\(c_t\\) the cell state. \\(f_t\\), \\(i_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively. \\(\\sigma\\) is used to squash values to \\((0, 1)\\) for gating, while \\(tanh\\) squashes values to \\((-1, 1)\\) for stability and zero-centered output.\n\n\n\nAn LSTM unit process the input data, \\(x_t\\), and the previous hidden state, \\(h_{t-1}\\), and the cell state, \\(c_{t-1}\\), through several gating mechanisms, updates the cell state to \\(c_t\\) and the hidden state to \\(h_t\\). Let \\(c_t\\) and \\(h_t\\) denote the cell and the hidden state vector. Let \\(f_t\\), \\(i_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) represent the forget, the input, and the output gate vector at time \\(t\\), respectively. Then, an LSTM unit can be expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\label{eq:lstm}\nf_t &= \\sigma(W_{fh} h_{t-1} + W_{fx} x_t + b_f), \\\\\ni_t &= \\sigma(W_{ih} h_{t-1} + W_{ix} x_t + b_i), \\\\\n\\tilde{c}_t &= \\tanh(W_{\\tilde{c} h} h_{t-1} + W_{\\tilde{c} x} x_t + b_{\\tilde{c}}), \\\\\nc_t &= f_t \\cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \\cdot \\tilde{c}_t, \\\\\no_t &= \\sigma(W_{oh} h_{t-1} + W_{ox} x_t + b_o), \\\\\nh_t &= o_t \\cdot \\tanh(c_t),\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\) denotes the weight matrices, \\(\\boldsymbol{b}\\) the bias vectors, \\(\\sigma\\) the logistic sigmoid function, and \\(tanh\\) the hyperbolic tangent function.\nThe internal structure of an LSTM unit consists of several components that work together to regulate information flow at each time step \\(t\\):\n\nThe forget gate, \\(f_t\\), controls the extent to which information is discarded or retained. The forget gate outputs values in range \\((0, 1)\\), where \\(0\\) means the information is completely discarded, and \\(1\\) means it is fully retained. The values never reach \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), since the range is exclusive.\nThe input gate, \\(i_t\\), regulates the amount of new information to add. The input gate outputs values in in range \\((0, 1)\\), where \\(0\\) means no information is added, and \\(1\\) means it is nearly fully added. The values never reach \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), since the range is exclusive.\nThe network computes the candidate values, \\(\\tilde{c}\\), which represents the proposed new information.\nNext, the cell state, \\(c_t\\), is updated by combining the previous cell state, \\(c_{t-1}\\), and the candidate values, \\(\\tilde{c}\\). As previously mentioned, \\(f_t\\) controls how much irrelevant information to discard, while \\(i_t\\) determines how much new information to incorporate when updating the cell state.\nThen, the output gate, \\(o_t\\), determines the extent to which the cell state, \\(c_t\\), is exposed to the hidden state, \\(h_t\\).\nThe hidden state, \\(h_t\\), is updated by taking the cell state, \\(c_t\\), and scaling it with the output gate, \\(o_t\\). This resulting hidden state, \\(h_t\\), is the final output of the LSTM network at time \\(t\\).\n\nTo produce the output, \\(\\hat{y}_t\\), a fully connected layer, where every neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, is applied to the hidden state, \\(h_t\\). This layer performs a linear transformation, effectively mapping the high-dimensional representation learned by the LSTM to the target output space. For regression tasks, the output is typically a single scalar representing the prediction, and no non-linear activation is applied, allowing the network to generate an unconstrained real value.",

    "text": "17.3 Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Metrics\nDuring training, forward pass involves passing input data, \\(x_t\\), through the network to generate a predicted value, \\(\\hat{y}_{t}\\), for each time step from \\(t =1\\) to \\(T\\), as outlined in the steps above in Section 17.2.1. The error is then calculated using a loss function, which measures the discrepancy between the predicted output, \\(\\hat{y}_t\\), and the target value, \\(y_t\\). The total loss is computed by summing up the loss over time:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y}, y) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\ell(\\hat{y}_t, y_t),\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) represents the overall loss accumulated over time and \\(\\ell_i\\) the loss at each time step \\(t\\).\nBackpropagation involves propagating the error backward through the network, from time step \\(t = T\\) to \\(1\\), and computing the gradients of the objective function with respect to each parameter in the network. These gradients guide how the network parameters should be updated in order to minimize the loss. For sequence-based models, such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) procedure (Paul J. Werbos 1988; P. J. Werbos 1990) is employed as an extension of the standard backpropagation algorithm. BPTT unfolds the network across time steps, allowing the computation of gradients for the entire sequence of inputs. For the specific derivation of LSTM gradients, we refer the reader to Chen (2016) and Sherstinsky (2020).\nOnce the gradients are computed using BPTT, standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) (Kingma and Ba 2014), can be used to update the parameters in the direction that minimizes loss. The following update rule reflects the basic form of SGD, where parameters are adjusted using the gradient, scaled by the learning rate:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\alpha \\, \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\{W_{fx}, W_{ix}, W_{\\tilde{c}x}, W_{ox}, W_{fh}, W_{ih}, W_{\\tilde{c}h}, W_{oh}, \\boldsymbol{b}\\}\\) in \\(\\eqref{eq:lstm}\\) denotes the set of network parameters, with \\(\\boldsymbol{b}\\) representing all bias vectors collectively, \\(\\alpha\\) the learning rate, and \\(\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\) the gradient of the loss function with respect to \\(\\theta\\).\nThe process of forward pass, backpropagation, and parameter updates is repeated over multiple epochs until convergence. Convergence is typically determined by stopping criterion such as early stopping based on validation loss, reaching a predefined number of epochs, and when the improvement in loss between epochs falls below a specified threshold (Goodfellow et al. 2016).\nHyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in improving model performance. Key hyperparameters include, for example:\n\nBatch Size\nNumber of Epochs\nLearning Rate\nNumber of Hidden Units or Cell Dimension\nNumber of Hidden Layers, etc.\n\nBatch size refers to the number of training samples or sequences processed simultaneously by the network in one forward and backward pass before updating its parameters. An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset, during which the network processes all batches once, performing one forward and one backward pass per batch. The number of epochs refers the the number of passes the network iterates over the full dataset to achieve optimal training of the RNN.\nThe learning rate controls how much the network’s parameters are adjusted during training in response to the gradients of the loss function. The effectiveness of the learning rate often depends on the optimizer used.\nThe cell dimension and the number of hidden layers and are two additional hyperparameters that define the structure of the RNN architecture. The cell dimension refers to the size of the hidden state vector, which corresponds to the number of neurons or nodes inside each RNN cell. The number of hidden layers determines how many recurrent layers are stacked on top of each other.\nHyperparameter tuning can be performed manually through hand tuning or automatically using methods such as grid search and random search (Bergstra and Bengio 2012). Manual search, also known as manual hyperparameter tuning, involves adjusting hyperparameters based on commonly used defaults, insights from prior literature, and feedback from model performance, while automated tuning involves systematically searching the hyperparameter space. Grid search exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations within a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while random search samples hyperparameter values randomly from specified distributions for evaluation.\nEvaluation metrics are essential for assessing performance and guiding improvements. ?tbl-metrics presents a list of common metrics used for evaluating forecasting models.\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE), like Mean Squared Error (MSE), penalizes outliers, but is more interpretable, since it is expressed in the same units as the target value. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) treats all errors linearly, so it is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE or RMSE.\nMSE, RMSE, and MAE are scale-dependent metrics. In contrast, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Symmetric MAPE (SMAPE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) are scale-independent, allowing for comparison across datasets with different units. Finally, Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) addresses some of the limitations of MAPE and SMAPE by scaling errors relative to a naive forecast, serving as an additional metric for evaluating forecast accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nAhmed, Sabeen, Ian E Nielsen, Aakash Tripathi, Shamoon Siddiqui, Ravi P Ramachandran, and Ghulam Rasool. 2023. “Transformers in Time-Series Analysis: A Tutorial.” Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing 42 (12): 7433–66.\n\n\nAnsari, Abdul Fatir, Lorenzo Stella, Caner Turkmen, Xiyuan Zhang, Pedro Mercado, Huibin Shen, Oleksandr Shchur, et al. 2024. “Chronos: Learning the Language of Time Series.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815.\n\n\nBengio, Yoshua, Patrice Simard, and Paolo Frasconi. 1994. “Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent Is Difficult.” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 5 (2): 157–66.\n\n\nBergmeir, Christoph. 2024. “LLMs and Foundational Models: Not (yet) as Good as Hoped.” Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting 73.\n\n\nBergstra, James, and Yoshua Bengio. 2012. “Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization.” The Journal of Machine Learning Research 13 (1): 281–305.\n\n\nBrown, Tom, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakantan, et al. 2020. “Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners.” Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33: 1877–1901.\n\n\nChen, Gang. 2016. “A Gentle Tutorial of Recurrent Neural Network with Error Backpropagation.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:1610.02583.\n\n\nCho, Kyunghyun, Bart Van Merriënboer, Caglar Gulcehre, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Fethi Bougares, Holger Schwenk, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014. “Learning Phrase Representations Using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:1406.1078.\n\n\nDas, Abhimanyu, Weihao Kong, Rajat Sen, and Yichen Zhou. 2024. “A Decoder-Only Foundation Model for Time-Series Forecasting.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10688.\n\n\nDevlin, Jacob, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. 2019. “Bert: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.” In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), 4171–86.\n\n\nEkambaram, Vijay, Arindam Jati, Pankaj Dayama, Sumanta Mukherjee, Nam H.

    "text": "18.1 Network Configuration\nIn this section, we provide an overview of network architecture, training process, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics for the LSTM network used in our study.\nOur design choices are informed by the findings of Hewamalage, Bergmeir, and Bandara (2021), which guide the appropriate settings for the LSTM network. The architecture consists of an input layer, followed by one to two LSTM layers, and concludes with a dense layer to balance model complexity and performance.\nThe network is trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) (Mozer 2013; Robinson and Fallside 1987; Werbos 1988). Although the open-source Cocob (COntinuous COin Betting) optimizer is reported to perform the best, we use the built-in Adam optimizer for its practical convenience and competitive performance. The learning rate is initially set to \\(0.001\\), consistent with recommended ranges for Adam. The batch size and cell dimension are initially set to \\(32\\) and \\(64\\), respectively, to balance training efficiency with model capacity, forming the foundation of our chosen configuration. In Section 18.3.1.3, we vary these hyperparameters to explore their impact on model performance, but find no improvement. Consequently, we reuse the original configuration for subsequent experiments, including the data application.\nFinally, model performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, SMAPE, and MASE, consistent with the metrics discussed in Chapter 17.",

    "text": "18.2 Experimental Setup\nThe goals of the simulation studies are threefold: (1) to compare the predictive performance of the LSTM and MTD models, both generally for gamma data and specifically for zero-inflated gamma data, (2) to assess the stability and robustness of their performance, and (3) to investigate the impact of hyperparameters on LSTM performance.\nTo compare the predictive performance of the LSTM and MTD models under various conditions, we run both models on Gamma Scenario 1–9 (see ?tbl-scenarios of Part I for details) and assess their performance using RMSE as the primary evaluation metric. Each model is trained and tested under identical data splits with a ratio of \\(0.8\\) to ensure a fair comparison.\nTo assess the stability and robustness of model performance, we run both the LSTM and MTD models on 10 independently generated replicates of Gamma Scenario 1 (see ?tbl-scenarios of Part I for details). Each replicate consists of a new synthetic dataset generated using the same underlying parameters but with different random seeds. This setup allows us to quantify the variability in model outcomes arising from randomness in data generation and model training, and to evaluate whether the observed performance differences between the LSTM and MTD models are statistically significant.\nTo investigate the impact of hyperparameters on LSTM performance, we run the network with a variety of configurations on Gamma Scenario 1 with 10 independently generated replicates for each configuration. The configurations explore key hyperparameters including the learning rate, the batch size, the number of layers, and the number of hidden units. Specifically, we evaluate the following LSTM configurations:\n\nLearning rate: \\(0.1\\), \\(0.01\\), and \\(0.001\\)\nBatch size: \\(1\\), \\(8\\), \\(16\\), \\(32\\), \\(64\\), and \\(128\\)\nNumber of layers: \\(1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(3\\)\nHidden cell dimensions: \\(32\\), \\(64\\), and \\(128\\)\n\nThis setup allows us to assess the sensitivity of LSTM performance to hyperparameter choices, identify optimial configurations that yield consistent and robust results, and inform the selection of settings for experiments conducted in Chapter 19.\nFor the zero-inflated Gamma settings, we focus exclusively on Scenario 1 (see ?tbl-scenarios-zigamma of Part II for details), since each scenario includes six cases defined by all combinations of \\(P = 0.1, 0.5, 0.7,\\) and \\(\\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4\\), where \\(P\\) represents the zero-inflated probability and \\(\\epsilon\\) denotes the threshold value. We similarly run both models and evaluate their performance using RMSE, allowing us to specifically examine model behavior on zero-inflated data. Additionally, we compute RMSE below (i.e., RMSE for data less than or equal to \\(\\epsilon\\)) and above (i.e., RMSE for data greater than \\(\\epsilon\\)) to assess predictive accuracy in the lower and upper ranges, respectively. As discussed in Chapter 14, when \\(P\\) is small, a large proportion of observations fall above \\(\\epsilon\\), providing more information to estimate the value in the upper range. As \\(P\\) increases, more observations concentrate below \\(\\epsilon\\), making the RMSE in the near-zero range the primary indicator of the overall performance. These additional metrics provide insight into model performance for low and high-value regions, particularly relevant in the context of zero-inflated distributions.",

Scenarios 3 to 9 follow the same weight pattern as Scenario 1. Scenarios 3 to 6 evaluate gamma shape and rate, and Scenarios 7 to 9 consider high-skew cases.\n?tbl-pred-gamma-lstm-vs-mtd summarizes the RMSE comparisons between LSTM and MTD based on one-step ahead predicted means for Scenarios 1 through 9. The predicted results from LSTM and MTD are similar. RMSEs for MTD are lower in Scenarios 2, 3, 4, and 6, though the differences are minimal. Conversely, LSTM yields slightly lower RMSEs in Scenarios 7 to 9, though the differences are again minimal. RMSEs are the highest for both models in Scenario 2. ?tbl-pred-gamma-lstm-vs-mtd-bias presents the corresponding bias comparisons across the same scenarios. Overall, biases are small, with positive values indicating overestimation and negative values underestimation.\nFigure 18.1 illustrates these means for Scenario 1 and 2. Figure 18.2 presents a zoomed-in view of the same plot, focusing on a subset of the test data (\\(n = 200\\)). As shown in Plot (a), both models predict well, with LSTM performing comparably to MTD. However, as shown in Plot (b), both models appear to struggle more in Scenario 2 compared to their performance in Scenario 1. Additional plots illustrating the predicted means for Scenarios 3 through 9 (Figure F.1, Figure F.2) are provided in the Appendix F Section F.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: One-step-ahead predicted means for (a) Gamma Scenario 1 and (b) Scenario 2: Solid (black) lines are true values.

Dashed (red) lines are LSTM predicted means and dashed (blue) lines are MTD predicted means.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.3.1.2 Experiment 2: Stability and Robustness Analysis\nUsing Scenario 1 with 10 replicates, we conduct additional analyses to evaluate model performance and assess whether the performance differences between LSTM and MTD are significant. Results from the paired t-test indicated a mean difference in RMSE of \\(0.1290\\) (\\(\\text{p-value} = 0.005175\\), \\(\\text{df} = 9\\)), with MTD consistently yielding lower RMSEs. Figure 18.3 illustrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Relative Performance of LSTM and MTD models for Gamma Scenario 1 (Mean RMSE for LSTM = 1.5290; Mean RMSE for MTD = 1.4000). Data points are connected by lines to indicate results from the same replicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.3.1.3 Experiment 3: Impact of Hyperparameters on LSTM Performance\nReusing Scenario 1 with 10 replicates, we perform additional analyses to determine whether hyperparameter tuning is necessary. For each hyperparameter, we conduct a repeated-measures ANOVA, treating hyperparameter levels as the treatment factor and replicate ID, representing different simulated data replicates, as the random effect. If the overall p-value is smaller than \\(0.05\\), we follow up with the Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons to identify which pairs differ significantly.\nAmong these configurations, the p-value is statistically significant for batch size (\\(\\text{Pr}(&gt;\\text{F}) = 4.4\\text{e}-06\\), \\(\\text{df} = 2, 24\\)), and pairwise comparisons indicate that RMSEs differ significantly only between batch size \\(64\\) and all other batch sizes (\\(1, 8, 16, 32,\\) and \\(128\\)), as well as between batch size 128 and all other batch sizes (\\(1, 8, 16, 32,\\) and \\(64\\)). The p-value is also significant for cell dimensions (\\(\\text{Pr}(&gt;\\text{F}) = 0.0113\\), \\(\\text{df} = 2, 24\\)); however, pairwise comparisons reveal significant differences in RMSE only between cell dimensions of \\(32\\) and \\(64\\), as well as between \\(32\\) and \\(128\\), but not between \\(64\\) and \\(128\\). Figure 18.4 illustrates these findings.\nThese results indicate that further hyperparameter tuning yields minimal performance gains. Notably, reducing the batch size slows down model training, although the model still completes within minutes, but does not produce a practical improvement in RMSE. Therefore, we adopt the default configuration for subsequent experiments: learning rate = \\(0.001\\), batch size = \\(32\\), number of layers = \\(1\\), and cell dimension = \\(64\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.4: Relative performance of LSTM networks with varying learning rates (0.1, 0.01, 0.001), batch sizes (1, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128), number of layers (1–3), and cell dimensions (32, 64, 128) for Gamma Scenario 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.3.2 Prediction for Zero-inflated Gamma Scenarios\n\n18.3.2.1 Experiment 4: Model Performance Comparison For Zero-inflated Gamma Scenarios\n?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd summarizes the RMSE comparisons between LSTM and MTD based on one-step ahead predicted means for Scenario 1, with rows correspond to all combinations of \\(Pi = 0.1, 0.5, 0.7,\\) and \\(\\epsilon = 0.1, 0.4\\), where \\(P\\) is the zero-inflated probability and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the threshold value. LSTM generally achieves lower overall RMSEs compared to MTD.\nHowever, patterns similar to those in Chapter 14 of Part II reappear. The overall RMSE can obscure important differences in predictive performance. To provide a clearer picture, we decompose the RMSE into below (which captures accuracy on values less than or equal to \\(\\epsilon\\)) and above (which reflects predictive accuracy for values exceeding \\(\\epsilon\\)) in ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-lu. Specifically, for zero-inflated gamma data with low zero-inflation probability (e.g., \\(P = 0.1\\)), the RMSE above is a more informative measure of performance. As \\(P\\) increases, this relationship reverses, and the RMSE below becomes more relevant. As shown in ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-lu, when \\(P = 0.1\\), MTD outperforms LSTM in RMSE above. This trend persists at higher levels of zero-inflation (e.g., \\(P = 0.5\\), \\(0.7\\)), where MTD again yields lower values for RMSE below than LSTM. ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-bias presents the corresponding bias comparisons across the same scenario. Similar pattern emerges.\nFigure 18.5 illustrates these patterns for Scenario 1. Figure 18.6 presents a zoomed-in view of the same plot, focusing on a subset of the test data (\\(n = 200\\)). Results for Scenario 2 (?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-s2, ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-s2-lu, ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-s2-bias, ?tbl-pred-zigamma-lstm-vs-mtd-s2-lu-bias, Figure F.3, Figure F.4) are provided in Appendix F Section F.2 and are similar to those in Scenario 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.5: One-step ahead predicted means for ZIGamma Scenario 1: Solid (black) lines are true values.

    "text": "19.2 Results\n\n19.2.1 Prediction Results\nIn the initial configuration, the LSTM network are trained using an L2 loss function and evaluated against the MTD model using RMSE. For MAE evaluation, a separate LSTM is trained with an L1 loss function. In contrast, MTD does not rely on training with an explicit loss function.\nTo facilitate a more rigorous and independent comparison, we incorporate additional error metrics, namely MAPE, SMAPE, and MASE to evaluate and compare the performance of the LSTM and MTD models. All LSTM models are trained using an L2 loss function, except for the one evaluated with MAE, which is trained using an L1 loss function.\nAs shown in Tables (?tbl-real-uv50, ?tbl-real-uv10, ?tbl-real-uv2), MTD consistently outperforms the LSTM models across all evaluated metrics and training configurations for wind speeds at 50 m, 10 m, and 2 m above ground level. Since all reported MASE values are less than 1, this indicates that both models outperform the naïve forecasting benchmark on average.\nTo strengthen the comparison, we conduct an additional experiment by increasing the LSTM input window size, \\(W\\), and the MTD order, \\(L\\), from \\(5\\) to \\(15\\) (i.e., longer look-back steps). We then re-evaluate these models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SMAPE.\nAs shown in Tables (?tbl-real-uv50-L15, ?tbl-real-uv10-L15, ?tbl-real-uv2-L15), the performance of the LSTM network shows slight improvement with a larger window size, though the gains are minimal. In contrast, the MTD model shows no performance gain, but still consistently outperform the LSTM across all metrics.\nGiven that batch size appears to be an important hyperparameter for LSTM, we further test values of \\(8\\), \\(16\\), \\(64\\), \\(128\\), and \\(256\\), compared to the baseline of \\(32\\). Nevertheless, none of these settings yield better performance than the MTD model.

Through simulation studies, we compare both the Gamma MTD and ZIGamma MTD models against the LSTMs. For gamma time series, Gamma MTD and LSTM perform comparably, although further assessment using 10 replicates of Scenario 1 shows that MTD consistently outperforms LSTM. For zero-inflated gamma time series, ZIGamma MTD also outperforms the LSTM, which is expected given the challenges of modeling zero-inflated data, and LSTMs are less specialized for handling this type of data.\nIn real-world data applications, we focus on comparing the Gamma MTD with LSTMs to assess their practical performance. In this case, Gamma MTD consistently outperforms the LSTM across all evaluation metrics for all three datasets, including wind speed measurements (m/s) at heights of 50 m, 10 m, and 2 m above ground level.\nAlthough the MTD framework can, in principle, be extended to handle non-stationary time series and incorporate predictors incorporating additional model elements into the conditional mean structure (Zheng, Kottas, and Sansó 2022), these extensions have not yet been implemented. In addition, it is currently limited to a univariate setting. Consequently, it cannot effectively model non-stationary data, simultaneously capture the effects of past observations and relevant predictors, or account for multivariate dependence. Future research directions include extending the model to handle non-stationary features, account for variability in wind speed due to factors such as air density, and incorporate the dependence of wind speed across different heights.\nProbabilistic models like MTDs offer greater robustness and interpretability due to their probabilistic nature, allowing uncertainty quantification and insights into temporal dependence. Their robustness stem from their ability to capture complex patterns without overfitting, while their structure provides interpretable parameters. However, models such as Gamma MTD and ZIGamma MTD require careful design and specification. In contrast, deep learning networks such as LSTMs are more general-purpose and enable faster computation, though their black-box structure limits interpretability. Therefore, MTD is better suited for explainable and robust modeling, whereas LSTMs are advantageous for large-scale or computationally intensive tasks.\nWith the growing adoption of transformer architectures, which leverage multi-head attention to model dependence in parallel, future research in sequence modeling should extend these comparisons to include transformer-based models. It is equally important that such comparisons are grounded in appropriate benchmarks and evaluated with suitable metrics to ensure fair and valid conclusions regarding model performance.\nBuilding on the perspectives outlined by Wikle and Zammit-Mangion (2023), who reviewed traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches for spatial and spatio-temporal data and highlighted the development of hybrid models for latent processes, data, and parameter specifications, a promising avenue for future research is the exploration of hybrid modeling strategies for time series data. Integrating classical probabilistic models with AI-driven architectures could combine the robustness and interpretability of probabilistic approaches with the flexibility and efficiency of neural networks, providing a rich framework for modeling complex features such as skewness, zero-inflation, and temporal dependence.\n\n\n\n\nWikle, Christopher K, and Andrew Zammit-Mangion. 2023. “Statistical Deep Learning for Spatial and Spatiotemporal Data.” Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application 10 (1): 247–70.\n\n\nZheng, Xiaotian, Athanasios Kottas, and Bruno Sansó. 2022. “On Construction and Estimation of Stationary Mixture Transition Distribution Models.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 31 (1): 283–93.",

    "text": "In this dissertation, we develop a novel copula-based MTD model that separates the dependence structure from the marginal distribution. This separation enables a choice of copula families that effectively capture dependence and allows the marginal distribution to take any continuous form, providing flexibility in model specification. While we illustrate the approach using the Gamma MTD model, the framework can accommodate a wide range of continuous marginals, such as the lognormal and beta distributions.\nExtending this approach, we also propose a copula-based zero-inflated MTD model, which preserves the advantages of copula modeling for capturing dependence while allowing flexible choices of marginal distributions in zero-inflated continuous settings. This extension again demonstrates the framework’s generalizability to alternative marginals beyond the gamma distribution. Although we present the the Zero-Inflated Gamma MTD (ZIGamma MTD) model as an example, the same strategy can be applied to construct zero-inflated models with other alternative continuous marginals.\nBoth the Gamma MTD and ZIGamma models developed in this dissertation utilize a Gaussian copula to capture dependence, though alternative copula families, such as Clayton and Gumbel, can also be employed to better model tail dependence and asymmetry. Future work should explore alternative copula families and assess their impact on model performance. Furthermore, although the current framework assumes stationarity and does not incorporate predictors, it can be readily extended to non-stationary time series and covariate-dependent models by introducing extra model terms to the conditional mean structure, further enhancing flexibility and realism in modeling complex temporal patterns.\nThrough simulation studies and real-world applications, we illustrate how MTD and LSTM serve as complementary approaches for modeling complex, skewed, and zero-inflated time series. For gamma time series across various scenarios, Gamma MTD and LSTM perform comparably; however, using 10 replicates of Scenario 1, which features exponentially decreasing weights and a vector of compatible dependence parameters, Gamma MTD outperforms LSTM consistently. For zero-inflated gamma time series, ZIGamma MTD outperforms LSTM consistently, highlighting the advantage of specialized models for handling zero-inflated data.\nIn real-world datasets, including hourly wind speed measurements at three different heights, Gamma MTD consistently outperforms LSTM, underscoring the robustness and interpretability of probabilistic models. While LSTMs offer general-purpose modeling, computational efficiency, and simpler model design, their black-box nature can limit interpretability and, in some cases, reduce accuracy. In contrast, MTD models provide more robust and explainable temporal modeling but come at the cost of increased computational complexity and more involved model design.\nOverall, the proposed copula-based MTD framework provides a flexible, robust, and interpretable approach for modeling complex skewed and zero-inflated time series, demonstrating superior performance compared to LSTM in the settings considered.\nGiven the growing prominence of transformer architectures in sequence modeling, future research should extend performance comparisons to include transformer-based models. It is equally important to ensure that evaluations are conducted using appropriate benchmarks and metrics. Finally, future work could explore integrated approaches that combine probabilistic models with neural architectures, aiming to leverage the strengths of both frameworks for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable time series modeling.",
