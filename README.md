## Using the Template

This template was built by Charlotte Wickham, based on the [`beavtex.cls`](_extensions/beav/beavtex.cls) style authored by Rick Treinen, Neville Mehta, Deling Ren, and John Metta.

If you are interested in using the template, follow the instructions on GitHub repository [beav-thesis](https://github.com/cwickham/beav-thesis). 

For the best experience, it is recommended to use [Positron](https://positron.posit.co).
